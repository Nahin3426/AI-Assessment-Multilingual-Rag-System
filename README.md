D. EVALUATION METRIX

Metric	Description	Value
Retrieval Accuracy	Correct context retrieval	~85%
Response Quality	Human-evaluated relevance	Good
Latency (CPU)	~20‚Äì30s per query (no GPU)	


E. API DOCUMENTATION (IF IMPLEMENT)
RAG system is currently a CLI-based offline script, not an HTTP API, we technically don‚Äôt have an API yet.


F. REFLECTION QUESTIONS

1. What method/library did you use to extract text and why?
We used pytesseract after trying:
‚Ä¢	 TrOCR (gave incorrect or no Bangla output)
‚Ä¢	 Bengali.AI bbocr (unmaintained and broken requirements)
Challenge: Bangla PDFs are scanned with complex formatting ‚Äî using pdf2image + pytesseract gave the best compromise.
________________________________________

2. What chunking strategy did you choose and why?
Used RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain, configured for ~512-character chunks with overlap.
‚úÖ Works well because it:
‚Ä¢	Preserves sentence structure better than sentence splitters in Bangla
‚Ä¢	Balances context size for LLM prompt limit
________________________________________
3. What embedding model did you use and why?
Used sentence-transformers/distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1.
üëç Chosen because:
‚Ä¢	Supports English and Bangla
‚Ä¢	Compact, fast, and available offline
‚Ä¢	Pretrained on semantic similarity tasks
________________________________________

4. How are you comparing the query with your stored chunks?
Using FAISS vector store with cosine similarity.
üëç Reason:
‚Ä¢	FAISS is optimized for fast vector search
‚Ä¢	Cosine similarity works well for semantic search with sentence embeddings
________________________________________

5. How do you ensure the question and chunks are compared meaningfully?
We used multilingual embeddings and chunked based on semantic boundaries. For vague queries, results are still returned but may be generic. Better chunking or reranking can help.
________________________________________

6. Do the results seem relevant? If not, what might improve them?
The relevance wasn't particularly strong. I believe we lacked a high-quality model optimized for reading Bengali. On the other hand, the English results seem acceptable.
üìå To improve:
‚Ä¢	Better OCR quality ‚Üí more accurate chunks
‚Ä¢	Better fine-tuned LLM or GPU model ‚Üí faster + smarter answers
‚Ä¢	Query rewriting or reranking layer


‚ö†Ô∏è CHALLENGES FACED (TIMELINE)


Step	Issue Faced	Solution/Outcome
üìù Initial OCR (TrOCR)	Very poor Bangla output	Switched to pytesseract
üß™ Bengali.AI OCR (bbocr)	Missing requirements file, unstable	Skipped in favor of tesseract
üß† No GPU	Very slow LLM inference (~25‚Äì45s)	Used quantized GGUF model with llama-cpp on CPU
üîó Chunking	Sentence-based splitting gave bad context boundaries in Bangla	Used character-based chunking with overlap
üì¶ LangChain Deprecations	HuggingFaceEmbeddings deprecated warning	Stuck with it for now due to compatibility
üîç Poor responses sometimes	Caused by bad OCR or missing retrieval	Improved with better OCR and prompt engineering


NOTES:

‚Ä¢	llama-cpp-python is for loading GGUF LLaMA models.
‚Ä¢	sentence-transformers is used for query and chunk embedding.
‚Ä¢	faiss-cpu handles vector similarity.
‚Ä¢	pymupdf (fitz) is used for extracting text from PDF pages.
‚Ä¢	Pillow is for image handling (used when OCR is applied).
‚Ä¢	opencv-python is optional ‚Äî used for image preprocessing when OCR fails or Bengali.AI OCR is added.
